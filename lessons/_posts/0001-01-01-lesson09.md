### Mouse pew pew shooter

In this example, we're going to have pygame shoot projectiles from the mouse when the mouse is clicked:

{% include codeinclude.html file='bullets_finished.py' %}

### Keyboard pew pew shooter

Can we adjust the program to have a character rectangle that the player moves around with arrow keys, and when the player presses the spacebar, it fires projectiles (instead of the mouse)?

{% include codeinclude.html file='bullets_game_v0.py' %}

### Keyboard multi-direction pew pew shooter

If you did that, can you use WASD to change the direction that the projectiles are shot from the character's rectangle? (e.g., 'w' points projectiles upward, 'd' to the right, etc)

{% include codeinclude.html file='bullets_game_v1.py' %}
