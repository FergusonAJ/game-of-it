## Pygame - Collisions

We can detect collisions between rectangles using a `colliderect` instruction. In the example below, we have two rectangles: one following your mouse around and another that doesn't move. Anytime the mouse-following rectangle overlaps (collides) with the non-moving rectangle, we randomize the color of the mouse-following rectangle.
