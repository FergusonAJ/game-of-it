Why python?

### Getting Started

- Make your own directory on the shared network drive.
- [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) _should_ already be installed on your computer!
  - Thonny is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. In simpler terms, it's the application you'll use to edit and run your Python programs.
  - There should be a shortcut on your desktop for Thonny. If you can't find it (or it doesn't work), let us know!
