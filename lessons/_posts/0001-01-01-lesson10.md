### Text

We skipped over rendering text yesterday, so let's revisit that...

Drawing text in pygame is _a lot_ like drawing images.

{% include codeinclude.html file='text_finished.py' %}

**CHALLENGE:** Make each of the three texts a different font type and font size.

### Buttons

Buttons in pygame are very simple: they're rectangles that we draw on the screen, and we detect button presses by detecting collisions between the mouse pointer and the button rectangle when the player clicks.
We can also use an image as a button.
You'll need to download [red-button.png](/media/red-button.png) into the folder containing your Python file for the code below to work.

{% include codeinclude.html file='buttons.py' %}

**CHALLENGE:** Add another button that resets the click counts for the other two buttons.
- Extra challenge: add a button that disables the other buttons (prevents them from being clicked)

### Menus

Menus are just several buttons strung together.
We can make a menu screen by having multiple game modes.
In the example below, we have two game modes:
1. a title screen mode and
2. a menu screen mode.
In the menu screen, the player uses the arrow keys to navigate (we could have used the mouse here instead), and presses enter to make a selection.

{% include codeinclude.html file='menu.py' %}

**CHALLENGE:** Add another option to the menu screen that changes the title screen's background
