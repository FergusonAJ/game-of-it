# Making a Game of IT - Day 3 - Pygame

## Pygame - Sprites and More Collision(?)

## Pygame - Buttons and Menus

Buttons in pygame are very simple: they're rectangles that we draw on the screen, and we detect button presses by detecting collisions between the mouse pointer and the button rectangle when the player clicks.

{% include codeinclude.html file='buttons.py' %}

<!-- {% include codeinclude.html file='menu.py' %} -->

## LUNCH SPECIAL TASK

Brainstorm the _type_ of game you're interested in making.

For example...

## Pygame - Music and sound effects

## Pygame - High-level structure

<!-- {% include codeinclude.html file='block_catchy.py' %} -->
